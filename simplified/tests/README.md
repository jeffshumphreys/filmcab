Tests

Abstract:Used for any scripts I write to test some feature before using it in real code, either in scheduled or manual sections.

# WARNING
**Reload VS Code or kill the Powershell terminal if you use any functions in these!!!!! They will be available to real code, and may override any functions in your real code!**
