 #    FilmCab Daily morning batch run process: Extract all the "_" folders and determine what genre to assign the directory.
 #    Called from Windows Task Scheduler, Task is in \FilmCab, Task name is same as file
 #    Status: Prepping for addition to schedule.

 #    Needs refactoring:
      - Traverse EVERY "_" folder, then track back parentage?
      - Add entire tree of genres to directory entry as "genres" array.
      - Capture genres hidden under uh non-genre folders. Hmmmm. Time to have a "hidden" property? ðŸ¤¨
      Question:Do we count all movies below a genre or just until a subgenre?
      For instance:
      - Does _Dsytopia include the movies in _Dystopia\_Police State?  Rignt now they're excluded I think.
      - Technically, everything below a folder is that genre, but then the counts would be off.
