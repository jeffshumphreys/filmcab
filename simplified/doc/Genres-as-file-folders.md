# _Adventure
Is it an action, adventure or Western?  A lot of westerns are Adventures, but some are more about family, showdowns and such.

# _AI
I separate this from Sci Fi because it's not really fiction anymore.  Travel to other worlds, travel through time, that's still sci-fi.

# _Camp
Cheese, usually older, though some stuff comes up in modernity. "Abraxas Guardian of the Universe  (1990)" is camp sci-fi.

# _Classics
Has a lot of old romance movies.  Noir I don't keep here.

# _Comedy
Funny ha-ha. Some, like Danny Kaye, include some cutsie stuff, family friendly.

# _Communism
Never you mind. Ayn Rand, etc. Not the other stuff.

# _Documentaries
This all kind of documentaries, not including reality shows or how-tos.

# _Dystopia
A lot of variety in here that most normal people would call something else, like Sci-Fi. 
## _Police State
Essentially a dystopia where the type of film manifests as a police state. Not fully realized, as some in the root folder could go in here.

# _Existentialism
My raison detre, which is funny since, well, existential. "A Passage to India" would go in here. Why does she exist? What did she ever know?

# _Fantasy
All the bad stuff, but some good.  It's a bit of a didactic split, in that it's fantastical in nature, which includes Swords and Sorcery, Harry Potter, Wizardry, Tomb Raider, Hellboy.  If it's more apt for family then it goes there regardless of its fantastical nature.

# _Fascism
Who knows what's in here. No idea.

# _Historical
This ended up a little dark. "Black Sun" would go here, for example, and I have no will to watch it. I know what's in it.  But important films.
* I plan to drop some historical fiction, like "The Sand Pebbles" - if I bought that.  These aren't really documentaries.

# _Holocaust
These are important, and I've watched some of them. They are to be segregated from Documentaries because nobody except me and Woody Allen want to watch these.


# _Horror
Not necessarily that horrific.  "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", for example, is technically Horror, but more fascinating than scary.

# _Invasion
This is an odd one.  Is it Sci Fi? Should it go under there? But then the Huns invading Spain - where's that go.

# _Musicals
Because old people like this crap.  Not me, those other old people. 

# _Mystery
This is where I would spend a lot of time watching Nordic TV thrillers and police procedurals.

Under here is a folder called “Sherlock Holmes” to hold all the myriad of TV Series and TV Movies and streaming and theater releases, both British and American.

For other folders I use the show name and then S01, S02 and so on.
# _Sci Fi
All the science fiction has been moved  here.  This is stuff that's not Camp or cheesy.  Comedic scifi goes more under _Comedy.

# _Spy
Smiley's People, Mission Impossible.

# _Super Heroes
This is a dying genre. Since we're all suppose to raise up the diverse based on non-super attributes, we end up with weak or unbelievable characters.

# _Toxic Masculinity
Kept way over here to help prevent accidentally viewing of Rambo or worse.

# _War
What is it good for? Absolutely nothin! But we do it anyways.

***

And so on.
The key is that all movies have to be under a “_” folder so as to ease scrolling on the FireTV file explorer.
