# Extensions and Issues
## Markdown Preview Enhanced v0.8.11
###### Sat Mar 9 17:10:00 MST 2024
1. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K, V does not work, but from the context menu it works.
2. Why can't it just open when I select an MD file? Like every other file does? Click on a ps1 file, it's formatted in powershell!
   
## Better Align v1.4.2                                   
###### Sat Mar 9 17:13:45 MST 2024
I love the Alt+A command. Works great most of the time.
1. If there is a "`" in one of the lines, it ignores any more consecutive lines.

## TODO Highlight v1.0.5
###### Sat Mar 9 17:16:26 MST 2024
1. It does it everywhere, even if it's part of a Get-Warning, for instance. Need it to be only in a comment, and only if it's followed by a ":"
2. How can I control the colors?

## PowerShell v2024.3.1 (pre-release)
###### Sat Mar 9 17:19:28 MST 2024
1. Ctrl+F2 renames partial strings, too.  Also renames strings inside quotations, not just variables.

## TODO Highlight v1.0.6
###### Sat Mar 9 17:22:52 MST 2024
1. Is this enhancing the included Ctrl+Shft+Alt arrow columnar select? I notice as I shift left and right it smartly selects words and boundaries, which is an incredible speedifier.

## Inline SQL v2.16.0a
###### Sat Mar 9 17:24:53 MST 2024
1. Does nothing for PowerShell, so I'd have to modify it. Making embedded SQL readable inside PowerShell script would help my poor eyes.
