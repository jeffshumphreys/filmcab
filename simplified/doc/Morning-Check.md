# Morning Check

## Open Office Door

1. Did the computer reboot into a locked state and so didn't restart qBitTorrent? Login and restart.
2. Turn on light.
3. Look at computer screens.
4. Sit.
5. Look. This warms the cockles.

## Check Download Status

1. **qBitTorrent**
2. _archive.org_
3. _YouTube_

## Add New Payloads to Download

1. Are there no active downloads? Then find something.
2. Is there some massive 100GB payload and I want it to finish, then don't add any new stuff. I speculate that overly long running a single-source download can end up incomplete or stopped due to algorithm suspecting you are not active.
3. Waiting for stalled or Getting metadata to run, hoping no active downloads means they might run, is fruitless.
4. Check keep list for things written down yesterday as interesting. Chances are they're not.

## Check Windows Task Scheduler

1. Any tasks show an incomplete output? Fix script. Or rerun it.
   1. If the machine was locked after a reboot when this was scheduled to start; you'll get the following event: `_Task Scheduler failed to launch action ":\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" in instance "{b6eabe53-6b2c-40cf-bdf8-62fa31299044}" of task "\FilmCab\back_up_unbackedup_published_media". Additional Data: Error Value: 2147942402._`

## Check Database Exports

1. Is the file there from last night?
2. How big is the database backup file? Do we need to roll off some crap backups?

## Check Keep List

1. Anything I want to search for or remove?
2. Update excel spreadsheet from Keep list movies marked as watched.

## Edit User Excel Interface Spreadsheet

1. Clean up?
2. Missing years?

## Open VS Code

1. Gets your mind going. Probably had something running overnight, check it.

## Open DrawIO

1. Check the process flow(s). It's out-of-date. Update it.
