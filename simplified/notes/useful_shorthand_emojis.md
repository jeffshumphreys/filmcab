    ⛔, ❌, ❎  => Delete.                                   

    ⭐, 🌟 => Added, inserted. Not great. 

    📝, ✍ => Update or edit. No good update I can find. Suggested 🔄, but more like a Refresh. 🔨?

    🥂, 👏, 🎯 => Success, in terms of a feature completed.

    💣 => Crashed. Not a captured fail. Also, 💥 which is collision, maybe a deadlock? Race condition?

    🙁 => Failed, opposite of success, but not a crash. Maybe the network wasn't available - and we caught it. Uncaught errors are probably crashes

    🤨 => Warning, concerned. Why'd we get that value?  

    🤔 => placeholder: is this a good idea? I don't want to forget it, but not sure.
    
    💡  => I have an idea, a concept, it's barely conceived. But it's fairly obvious in need of doing.

    🚧 => Working on. Still good after 30 years.

    👀 => Detected an event or error.                                                            

    🔍 => Search for or a field allowing a user to enter search values.

    📈, ✅, 👌, 👍, ✔.  => Verified correct.

    🏭 => Factory

    🌙 => "This process runs at night"

    🧹 => clean up after.

    📦 => A package that is to be delivered or made available for download.

    📃 => Document, not necessarily a text document.       

    🧪 => Test. 🎓 Passed all tests. Deployable.                                                                                              

    ⏰=> Scheduled event or task, triggers an execution

    ⚡ => Execute, start a process. Probably should be different between blocking and async.

    ⏳ => Some unwanted but perhaps unavoidable delay. Long running process. OR, waiting for when more stuff has been written, then write this.

    🐌 => Running reallly slow!

    🌱 => Seed (as in, torrent?) Creation? 

    🦄 => Very unlikely to happen

    🐷 => Resource hog           

    🧙 => Wizard, no sure what exactly to apply to
    
    🔒 => Is locked, or does lock
    
    💀 => This code or path or branch is dead, not being worked on
    
    💩 => This code or program or module is crap.
    
    🎭 => media files or streamed media, movies, films, tv shows, audio, print, pdfs. Could use 📕📚 for print.
    
    📺 => for specifically TV stuff, maybe streaming
    
    🐛 => bug!     
    
    👓 => scan or flag for scanning

    👴 => Code is showing its age                              

    💤, 😴 => Process is sleeping, or development has stagnated

    🏋️‍♂️ => Portion of code doing the majority of the work  

    🎲 => Random output, or quasi-random, or intermittent failure

    🧮 => Counts? Database? Collection?

    🌊 => Flood of data, tsunami of input or output. Flood of work.

    🪓=> This needs refactoring
    
    🔁 => Try op again
