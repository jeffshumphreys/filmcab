    ❗ => Alarm, what happened!!

    ⛔, ❌, ❎  => Delete.                                   
                    
    🌈 => Looking good

    ✋, 🎌 => Stop, Halt.                          

    📌, 🧷 ,📍 => Pin, Highlight.
    
    🏗️, 🛠️, 🧱 => Construct?

    ⭐, 🌟 => Added, inserted. Not great. 
    
    ✳️, ℹ️ => Note.

    🤞, 🍀 => How it works, not well tested.

    🚩 => Warning, danger
    🤨 => Warning, concerned. Why'd we get that value?  

    👋, 🛎️, 🔔  => Signal, Notify, alert, attention

    📝, ✍ => Update or edit. No good update I can find. Suggested 🔄, but more like a Refresh. 🔨?

    🥂, 👏, 🎯 => Success, in terms of a feature completed.

    💣 => Crashed. Not a captured fail. Also, 💥 which is collision, maybe a deadlock? Race condition?

    🙁 => Failed, opposite of success, but not a crash. Maybe the network wasn't available - and we caught it. Uncaught errors are probably crashes

    🤔, ❓ => placeholder: is this a good idea? I don't want to forget it, but not sure.
    
    💡  => I have an idea, a concept, it's barely conceived. But it's fairly obvious in need of doing.

    🏃‍♂️ => Running process.

    🚦 => Wait for triggering event.

    🧩 => A piece of the final puzzle.

    ♾️ => Infinite loop.                      

    ⚖️ => Weigh, balance, value.

    🩹 => patch.

    ✂️ => Cut.

    ➗ => Split.

    📎 => Attach

    🚧 => Working on. Still good after 30 years.

    👀 => Detected an event or error.                                                            

    🔍 => Search for or a field allowing a user to enter search values.

    📈, ✅, 👌, 👍, ✔, ✔️  => Verified correct. Also, found.

    🏭 => Factory

    🌙 => "This process runs at night"

    🧹 => clean up after.

    📦 => A package that is to be delivered or made available for download.

    📃 => Document, not necessarily a text document.       

    🧪 => Test. 🎓 Passed all tests. Deployable.                                                                                              

    ⏰=> Scheduled event or task, triggers an execution

    ⚡ => Execute, start a process. Probably should be different between blocking and async.

    ⏳ => Some unwanted but perhaps unavoidable delay. Long running process. OR, waiting for when more stuff has been written, then write this.

    🐌 => Running reallly slow!

    🎭, 🎞️, 🎦, 📽️, 🎬, 🎥 => media files or streamed media, movies, films, tv shows, audio, print, pdfs. Could use 📕📚 for print.
